 CSCI 3110
 Program Description: This program ask the user for a name of one of the three maze files: myMaze1.dat, myMaze2.dat, and myMaze3.dat and prints out the corresponding maze with the appropriate path from entrance point to exit point (if one exisits) using the process of backtracking and recursion to solve the standard maze problem
